Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed using two small functions implemented here, in addition, non-square matrices are supported.

Block diagonal matrices occur when we combine two dimensions of a data set along one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the decompr and gvcpackage have each country-industry combination occur on each edge of the matrix.
