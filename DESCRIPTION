Description: Several tools for handling block matrices and similar constructs. Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed using two small functions implemented here, in addition, now square matrices are supported. Block diagonal matrices occur when we combine two dimensions of a data set on one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the "decompr" and "gvc" packages have each country-industry combination occur on each edge of the matrix.
