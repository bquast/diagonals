Authors@R: person("Bastiaan", "Quast", email = "bquast@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Several tools for handling block matrices and similar constructs. Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed using two small functions implemented here, in addition, non-square matrices are supported. Block diagonal matrices occur when we combine two dimensions of a data set along one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the 'decompr' and 'gvc' packages have each country-industry combination occur on each edge of the matrix.
